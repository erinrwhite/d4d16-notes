# designing for digital - day 1

## jesse james garrett opening keynote

What's the highest compliment someone can pay to our work? Shaping thinking to help inform design. "I can't live without it."

First technology is the blunt tool that solves the problem
Then features
But we need to understand the underlying principle of the design problem
But we need to design experiences

**beautiful** - aesthetically appealing
**elegant** - maximizes implicity
**solution** - addresses a need
**that works** - is useful
= experience

user interface/logic/data. All users see is UI and the rest is magic. We shouldn't worry our users with the underlying technology.

Products are people too. What are the qualities of the people we want to surround ourselves with? The more complex systems are, the more we anthropomorphize them.

Good tech - use repeatedly over time, recommend to a friend, would buy again

Bad tech - people blame themselves

Strategy defines scope defines structure defines skeleton defines surface (similar to [initial UX diagram from JJG](http://www.jjg.net/elements/pdf/elements.pdf))

### strategy
User needs - not just what the product does, but how it does it - functional, emotional, psychological - contextual

Product objectives - objectives that don't address users can't generate loyalty

### scope
Functional specifications should be enabled by technology, not dependent on it. 

Content requirements - what do your users know, and what do they need to have explained? Speak their language

### structure
Interaction design - making interactions feel natural. Information architecture  structures reflect our understanding of concepts and hte world

### skeleton
Visual design, sensory experience

Stay aligned

understand emotiona/psych context
connect with psychology
maintain personality of product

## understanding understanding - design-focused services
"If the point of contact between the product and people becomes a point of friction, then the designer has failed." - Henry Dreyfuss

Services don't operate in a vacuum - they're interconnected with other services - ecologies of services

Meadows - [Thinking in Systems](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557)

Libraries are systems - interconnected in such a way that they produce their own pattern of behavior over time

Characteristics of a good service experience
 - anticipate needs
 - human contact
 - good communication
 - exceed expectations
 - taking ownership of problem
 - agency to make a change
 - ability to break through/accommodate

Bad service
 - adhering to old rules
 - inflexibility
 - "I can't make that call"
 - delayed responses
 - being made to feel dumb

#### design thinking 

Can be used to solve problems of any type

Families of design

Themes:
	 - human-centered
	 - problem-solving
	 - library as a system
	 - everything as a service
	 - + emergent themes from workshop

#### service design mindset
 - co-creation
 - making the intangible tangible - visualize processes using diagrams/visualizations
 - confirming with evidence
 - focus on user needs and *expectations*
 - holistic - look at the bigger picture
 - empathetic
 - open-minded - the "no devil's advocate rule" - don't shut down ideas
 - willingness to evolve

### case studies

#### reed - work with undergraduates

findings
 - students are creatures of habit
 - wayfinding
 - culture of the library
 - hierarchy of spaces
 - library spaces as consecrated spaces
 - naming conventions
 - additional services
 - chairs!
 - small repairs needed

what'd we learn?
 - pan early
 - test often
 - get buy-in early
 - communicate what you're doing and what you're NOT doing
 - don't be afraid to ask questions.

#### MSU - design research

"However much time you're spending on communication, it's not enough" 

Success stories
	- LGBTQ+ programming
	- love letters/breakup letters

### customer journey mapping (CJM)

Visual representation of the user journey and experience in using a service or space

Y axis: nouns
X axis: verbs
plot points: actions

Methods:
	- journey mapping
	- KJ technique
	- love letters
	- mind mapping
	- service safari
	- process mapping
	- service blueprint

## afternoon workshop: information architecture with abby covert

Information can be created for a lack of physical material. Example: hole on shelf w/content around it (price tags, other products)

Information is not the same as data or content. Data is facts/observations/qustions about something; content is whatever a user is interacting with; information is whatever a user interprets from the arrangement or sequence of things they encounter.

IA is the practice of making sense.

### ontology

The act of choosing the language to be used or not used within a specific context.

Examples:
 - capybara are fish for Catholic purposes
 - Facebook - "like" is a verb and a noun
 - Needle exchange program - enforcing use of "participant" rather than "user" and "addict"

If you don't name something, someone else probably will because we need words. 

Some organizations have a list of "words we don't use". Synonyms can be distracting and deciding on a word to use simplifies things greatly.


**Step 1.** Decide how many things (nouns) you have.
**Step 2.** Verbs. Synonyms are even more common here

Controlled vocabularies are boring as hell but very useful - distributing the ontological decisions we'e made. Contains each term; its definition and rules; and myths, synonyms and history. Remember definitions are made of words that need to be defined.

Define relationships between terms:
	- equivalence - guac and guacamole
	- hierarchical - guacamole is a dip
	- associative - dip, chips, crackers
	- sequence - chop, mash, squeeze, serve

5 takeaways:
 - Meaning can be slippery but udnerstanding perception is essential to communication
 - A lack of focuisng on language can cause confusion as well as scope creep
 - Nouns are best considered before verbs
 - Synonyms should be chosen purposefully and defined clearly
 - Controlled vocabularies are essential for complex projects

### taxonomy

Content + structure = intent

Example: how would you organize produce? 
 - fridge
 	+ crisper
 	+ no crisper
 - no fridge
 	+ squishy? windowsill
 	+ not squishy? plate

Example: use same produce, work together and organize for a website

The way you choose to organize info says something about you. Mental models matter most - an explanation for the way someone makes sense of something. These models shape our classification.

The strict definition is not necessarily what the user has in their mental model. Forcing our model or the strict definition on other people is not helpful.

LATCH system for organizing things via Richard Saul Wurman:
 - location
 - alphabetical
 - time
 - category
 - hierarchy

Also, [Ranganathan scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_classification).

There's no right or wrong way to architect information. There's no academically, theoretically, politically correct way to architect your information. **All we can do is measure our results against our intent.**

Common taxonomic patterns:
 - heterarchy vs. hierarchy
 	+ broad and shallow vs. narrow and deep
 	+ top down vs. bottom up
 - flow and sequence
 - hypertext
 - transclusion - making a window from one thing to another thing

5 takeaways
 - organizing things isn't the hard part. Agreeing is the hard part
 - the way you choose to organize something says something about you
 - there are 5 ways to organize anything, which really means a million ways
 - there's not right or wrong way to organize information
 - no two information architectures are the same
