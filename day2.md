# day 2

## service design workshop - matt franks

Products and companies are perceived as one and the same. Mobile: personal, intimate, omni-present

changed our expectations of availability for organizations
 - A single, personal relationship
 - organization boundaries
 - usability

"consumer-grade software"

Software embodying aspects of a personal relationship - first time user experience, continual use

Digital products support non-digital touchpoints

We experience these touchpoints collectively as our experience with the organization

Traditional, outdated business idea: silo'd products; market-driven vision of features over value; requirements gathering

Defining a service as: a series of interdependent touch-points, perceived by users as a single functioning entity, used together over time to solve a problem or achieve a goal

### design process and theory

1. **Ethnography** - problem-finding, not problem-solving. Example journey map of Yellow Bike Project in Austin
2. **Synthesis**
3. **Programming**


Takeaways:
 - be concerned about everything. If it impacts the user's experience, it's your job to fix it. But be prepared to do it yourself.
 - get out of the building. Go talk to people.
 - stop talking and make something.


## writing on the web: writing as design

Writing is user-centered!

Common problems in library text:
 - too much meta-narrative
 - jargon
 - no clear call to action

WYSIWYG tethers people to desktop publishing, concept of "page" - formatting rabbit holes

Staff/editors are users too!
 - fields for semantic elements
 - editors: bare essentials
 - help text to prompt editors
 - dashboards
 - revision as part of CMS workflows

Evidence-based revisions to writing
 - analytics on writing pages

Un-inverting the pyramid
 - title and image - 0-10 seconds
 - main topic, call to action, first impressions - 10-30 seconds
 - next steps links, scannable details - 30-60 seconds
 - more info, background - 60+ seconds

Content Strategy epilogue
 - too many content types, too many fields, too many owners

## libguides usability testing

At Temple. Subject, course, how do I guides

### research questions
Think-aloud usability testing, 5 students, 1 hr each. 

 - What layout improvements for homepage?
 	+ Having [left]side nav for how do I and course guides
 	+ All guides button sux
 	+ Browse by subject was hard, people looking for exact title matches, only one person searched
 	+ People generally confused with what a guide is
 - User behaviors with guide-level navigation?
 	+ page names need to have meaning
 - Amt of info on guide
 	+ extraneous links distracted users
 	+ large headings worked (example [Audre Lorde seminar guide](http://guides.temple.edu/c.php?g=145776&p=958761))
 - Finding articles
 	+ People selected databases that were familiar OR at the top of the list
 	+ Database names are important too, act as a cue for where to go
 	+ Novice users really really have trouble

### takeaways

Side nav works!
Homepage: "by librarian" button doesn't work
LibCal scheduling page doesn't work

System changes:
 - provide instructions about what the guides are and what to do from the homepage
 - make search more prominent
 - brand guides as research guides with a new banner
 - delete the by librarian link, link to libcal scheduling page
 - address headings at system level to create text hierarchy of text a la [university of arizona](http://libguides.library.arizona.edu/admissions)
 
 Guide changes:
  - use descriptive and ample tagging
  - tag course guides with relevant course topics and course codes to facilitate discovery of guides
  - use tab names that have meaning to users across contexts
  - if you link to a video, note in the description that it's a video
  - How Do I guides should be task-oriented and geared to helping user find quick info or complete a task
  - customize database descriptions to guide purpose
  - list fewer databases
  - when embedding a search box, consider whether both are actually needed
  - assume users don't have conceptual understanding of DBs/articles
  - design guides so they work for audiences with a range of research skill levels
  - give multiple options for getting help

### surprises/lessons learned

 - Communication is very important (with staff)
 - Even for small changes :|
 - prepare staff for co-viewing sessions
 - analysis is time-consuming
 - next up: card sorting - group and label, prioritize content; then task-based testing on revised guides

## Does the best library web design eliminate choice?

Jason Clark - [anticipatory design](http://dx.doi.org/10.3998/weave.12535642.0001.402)

We need to pay attention to privacy issues! It is an increasingly important part of UX.

[Kano model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_model)

[The Battle Is For The Customer Interface](http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/03/in-the-age-of-disintermediation-the-battle-is-all-for-the-customer-interface/)

Interaction costs and cognitive overload. By limiting choices, are we depriving users of opportunities for discovery? Or is choice overrated?

Anticipatory design: using context, user behavior, and personal data - when ethically available - to tailor experience. Algorithm+curation - the personal touch.

[the invasive valley of personalization](http://busynessgirl.com/the-invasive-valley-of-personalizatio/)

If our patrons knew what data we had, would they stay?

Next-feature fallacy

6 in 10 smartphone users stop an app installation if it's asking for too much private information

So what's the point? Anticipatory design requires trust. Privacy and personalization are not necessarily at odds. But 

## library innovation by design - michelle ha tucker, closing keynote

designthinkingforlibraries.com

Design thinking and human-centered design. User-centeredness is a fundamental way of seeing the world: venn overlap of desirability, viability, feasibility, center is innovation

the approach is patron-centered, based on learning by doing, and experimental. 

### inspiration

It takes fieldwork to gain insight. Surveys and focus groups are good for validation.

Exploratory research - what problems should we build against?
Iterative research - are we building the right thing?
Validating research - did we solve the problem with what we built?

### ideation

Ideation: "To have a good idea, first have a lot of ideas." But it's hard to have a lot of ideas. We fall in love with the first idea.

Myth about idea generation: lone genius comes up with ideas

Rules for group idea generation:
	 - go for quantity
	 - defer judgement
	 - encourage wild ideas
	 - build on ideas of others
	 - stay focused
	 - one conversation at a time
	 - be visual

### iteration

Prototyping - minimum viable product. Think with your hands - fail early and often. Brendan Boyle: "never show up to a meeting without a prototype" good way to stimulate conversation

The thread through all three stages is learning. If a design doesn't work, it's a gift. It gives you more time to spend on the next idea

### tensions between design thinking and libraries

Reflecting on data > imagining a future
Secondary research answers questions > Research opens up new questions
Org is structured by operational teams > Organization is driven by strategic teams
Failure is avoided > Failure is invited

[T-shaped people and X-shaped people](http://icon.asid.org/index.php/2014/04/08/ahead-of-the-curve-with-metaskills/)

innovation is a verb, not a noun; a process, not an outcome. Think big but start small.

Libraries are a living lab. Librarians are great service designers. Libraries are networked community infrastructure - connect education, economic development, civic engagement, etc. Build partnerships, collaborate, execute beyond one institution.
